How to setup project:

1) Clone project to your computer (better through visual studio using team explorerer(in the right of the screen))
2) Download node.js https://nodejs.org/en/ (I recomend to download recomended version because its most stable)
3) On visual studio installer go to "Modify" and install "ASP.NET and web development " and "Node.js development" 
3) When when node js is downloaded go to project forlder ../ICSS-Devbridge-Calendar-WebPage\Scripts\react in cmd (command prompt)
and write command "npm install"
4) If you made some changes in project and you want to see them in the webpage write command "npm run build" in cmd
